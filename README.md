# Operation-Final-Front-
Operation Final Front++ Secy Recruitment Task Submission


The repository contains files essentially for Part-II of `Operation Final Front++`.
* `adj_list_to_input_form.cpp` takes input as a (n x n) matrix, and converts it into a desire format for the `GraphSolving.cpp`.
* ``GraphSolving.cpp`` uses Djikstra's algorithm on `2N` nodes to find the `minimum` fuel cost to reach base $N-1$ from base $0$.
* `Explanation.md`, a markdown file which explains the input procedure, Djikstra's algorithm, and code working etc.
